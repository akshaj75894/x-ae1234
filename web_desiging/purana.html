        <h3 style ="text-align: center;"><b>The Puranas</b></h3>
        <p style = "text-align: justify; margin-right: 25%;margin-left:25%; font-size: smaller;">The Puranas are a vast genre of ancient Indian texts that encompass a wide range of subjects including cosmology, mythology, genealogy, philosophy, religious rituals, and moral teachings. The term "Purana" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Pura," meaning "ancient" or "old," and "ana," meaning "knowledge" or "lore." Together, "Purana" translates to "ancient lore" or "ancient tales." These texts are considered to be among the oldest literature in Hinduism and are believed to have been composed over a period spanning several centuries, from around the 4th century BCE to the 16th century CE.<br>

            The Puranas play a crucial role in Hindu religious and cultural traditions, serving as repositories of wisdom and spiritual knowledge. They are often classified into different categories based on their content and the primary deity they focus on, with the most commonly recognized classification being the division into the Mahapuranas (major Puranas) and the Upapuranas (minor Puranas). The Mahapuranas are further divided into eighteen primary texts, each dedicated to a specific deity or group of deities, while the Upapuranas comprise a larger number of supplementary texts that elaborate on various aspects of Hindu mythology and religious practices.<br>
            
            The Mahapuranas are revered as the most important among the Puranic texts due to their comprehensive coverage of various topics and their influence on Hindu religious thought and practice. They are traditionally grouped into three categories based on the predominant gunas (qualities) of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (darkness), with each category consisting of six Puranas. The Puranas belonging to the sattva guna are believed to emphasize the virtues of righteousness, morality, and spiritual wisdom, while those associated with rajas and tamas gunas may include narratives involving conflicts, passions, and darker aspects of existence.<br><br>
